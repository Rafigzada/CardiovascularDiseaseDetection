# CardiovascularDiseaseDetection

Disease Prediction Model using Machine Learning
## Project
This project uses historical data related to diseases to create a machine learning model that can predict whether a person is ill or not based on a set of input features. The model is exposed through an API, allowing users to input their data and receive predictions about their health status.

## Features
Historical disease data:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rafig77/data/main/cardio_train.csv
Machine learning model:GradientBoostingClassifier,DecisionTreeClassifier ML models are used 
API: How the API was built via FastAPI 

## Prerequisites
matplotlib==3.7.0
pandas==1.5.3
scikit-learn==1.2.1
numpy=1.23.5

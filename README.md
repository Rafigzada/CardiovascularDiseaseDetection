# CardiovascularDiseaseDetection

Disease Prediction Model using Machine Learning
## Introduction
This project uses historical data related to diseases to create a machine learning model that can predict whether a person is ill or not based on a set of input features. The model is exposed through an API, allowing users to input their data and receive predictions about their health status.

Features
Historical disease data: Describe the dataset you used, its source, and any preprocessing steps performed on the data.
Machine learning model: Explain the type of machine learning model you used (e.g., decision tree, random forest, logistic regression) and provide a brief overview of the model's architecture.
API: Detail how the API was built, what technologies or frameworks were used (e.g., Flask, Django, FastAPI), and how to access it.
Usage
Getting Started
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease-prediction.git
cd disease-prediction
Prerequisites
List any dependencies or prerequisites required to run the project, including Python libraries, packages, or tools.
